# Game Experiment_03
## Set up some sound effects for character actions, etc.

1. Added in a few JavaScript generated sound effects.
2. Note that audio context must be triggered by a click.
3. In the sounds.js file.

~~Note: Ongoing music will be separate. ~~
drum_jam.html is a bit of an experiment on that front, but merits further exploration, and a simpler non-AI approach.

*Update*
4. Just couldn't wait. Added in a song of sorts, that gets called by songStart() when you click the 'start' button.
5. Will revisit in the future. Would be nice to make a simpler more NES/Commodore 64 style sound generator/sequencer.
